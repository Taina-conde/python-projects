# Become a Pokemon Master 

In this project, I used Python Classes to create a Pokémon battle game. Every Pokémon has statistics associated with it like health, level, type, and a name. In battles, a Pokémon class interacts with another until one of them knocks out the other, which happens when it loses all its health points.
